![Tests](https://github.com/Adstefnum/ascent/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)
A SAAS for transferring data into online databases.

# TODO 
- csv upload
  - collect col names or ask if specified in csv
  - are cols already created or do I need to do that?
- json upload
- research other types to upload.
- support sql databases first and then later nosql.
- transfer across online databases.
